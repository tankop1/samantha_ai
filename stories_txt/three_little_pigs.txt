Once, the three little pigs left their home as it was time they built their own houses. The mother pig advised them to do their best.
The first pig took the easiest way and built a house of hay.
The second pig bulit a house with sticks, which was a little stronger than the first one.
The third pig remembered mother's advice and built a house with bricks.
Soon, a wolf came by. He huffed and blew the hay house.
The pig ran to the stick house. The wolf huffed and puffed and the stick house also came down.
The two pigs ran to the brick house. The wolf huffed and puffed but the house remained intact.
The pigs knew that the wolf would enter through the chimney and kept a pot full of boiling water under it. The wolf fell right into the pot.
Burnt, the wolf ran away but the pigs learnt their lesson.
