Once upon a time, there was a bear family living in a forest. One morning mama bear prepared porridge for breakfast. As it was hot papa bear decided to take mama bear and baby bear for a walk in the forest. Near the forest, there lived a beautiful girl named Goldilocks. As she had beautiful golden hair she was called so.
One morning she was walking in the forest and lost her way. She saw a cottage and knocked on the door. But nobody was there, so she went inside. 
The cottage belonged to three-bears. Goldilocks was very hungry. She saw three-bowls of porridge on the dining table. 
First, she tried a spoonful from papa bears big bowl and said: "This is too hot". Next, she tried from Mama bears medium bowl, and said: "This porridge is also too cold". Finally, she tried from baby bears a small bowl, and said: "This porridge is just right". And she ate the whole bowl. 
After eating, she saw three-chairs in that room. She sat on papa and mama bears chair, It was too big. She sat on baby bears chair and said that it was just right to sit.
While rocking the chair it broke down, and she fell down. 
Goldilocks felt very tired, so she went upstairs to the bedroom. She saw three-beds in the bedroom. She lied on the first bed and felt that the bed was too hard. The second bed was too soft. But the third bed felt just right and slept in it. 
Soon the three bears came home.
"What's this? Someone has been having my porridge" said the papa bear. "Someone has been my porridge too", said the mama bear. "Someone has finished all my porridge: cried baby bear. 
Papa and mama bear said that someone was sitting in their chair too. "Someone has broken my chair" cried the baby bear. 
They rushed to the bedroom. Both papa and mama bear said that there was someone who slept in their bed too. "Oh! Mama papa someone is sleeping in my bed" said the baby bear.
Goldilocks woke up and ran into the forest. She never returned.
